\section{Work Experience}
\subsection{2014--Present}{Raven Industries}
%\begin{rbitemize}
	%\twentyitem{2022}{Building Remote Team}{Facilitated in ``gelling'' a team of remote new grad hires. Listened to new team members and worked with leadership and other developers across teams to maximise the value our team could deliver. The team completed a critical feature from requirements gathering all they way through testing well before the deadline.}
	%\twentyitem{2021}{Raven Ambassador Program}{Work with the executive leadership to represent Raven in the community and to facilitate new company initiatives.}
	\twentyitem{2014--2019}{System and Method for Sensing and Edge}{Why is this number indented 10225984?}
	\twentyitem{2015}{Internationalization}{Decreased processing time and increased quality of translations from third party translators. Used python scripts to assess common errors and inconsistencies.}
	\twentyitem{2017}{core dump analysis}{Automate the process of quickly assessing and examining core dumps for various processes and machine architectures.}
	\twentyitem{2019}{Telematics}{Led the design and implementation for a new part of the system that collects key pieces of information from devices in the field and send it up to our could services. Particularly proud of this project because we had to coordinate across teams; embedded, application, cloud, and it turned out to be a smashing success.}
	\twentyitem{2020}{Mentor for internship program}{Although I've been involved with the internship program to a limited extent for most of my career at Raven, this particular experience shed light on some of my lesser used strengths.}

\subsection{2012}{DocuTap internship}
	%\twentyitem{2012}{QA \& Track and Analyse Revenue}{Used PROGRESS and SQL while working with the accounting department to build an application used to track and analyze revenue. Used JavaScript to write automated test scripts for running regression tests on EMR (Electronic Medical Record) software. Refactored Pearl scripts to improve runtime performance on periodic search for backups. Found and removed memory leaks.}

%\section{Other information}

%\subsection{Review}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
